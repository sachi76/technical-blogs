# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sachidanand

Welcome to my technical blog!

I'm a passionate backend developer with a love for **Java**, **system design**, and **contributing to open-source**. I'm currently diving deep into production-ready architectures, Spring Boot microservices, and tools like Docker, Kafka, and gRPC. My long-term goal is to crack into top engineering teams like **VMware**, **Red Hat**, or **Datastax** â€” and Iâ€™m documenting that journey here!

### ðŸ§  What you'll find on this blog:

- Deep dives into **Java and multithreading**
- Real-world examples of **system design**
- Open-source learnings from projects like **JHipster Lite**
- Clean, beginner-friendly explanations for complex backend topics
- Weekly blog posts.

### ðŸ›  Technologies I work with:

- Java 21, Spring Boot, REST APIs
- Docker, Kafka, gRPC
- GitHub Actions, SonarQube, CI/CD
- SQL & PostgreSQL
- JHipster Lite (Contributor)
